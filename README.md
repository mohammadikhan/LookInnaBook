# COMP 3005 Final Project (Look Inna Book)
My COMP 3005 Final Project repository. This is a web application that uses Express.js, PUG, JavaScript and CSS that interacts with a PostgreSQL relational database that implements a book store where users can search and purchase books and track their orders. The owners have the option to add, remove and view reports for books in the bookstore
